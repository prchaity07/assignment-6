##  Difference between var, let, and const

var → Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated.

let → Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.

const → Block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared (value stays constant).

## Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()

map() → Returns a new array with modified values.

forEach() → Loops through each item but does not return a new array.

filter() → Returns a new array with only items that match a condition.

## Destructuring assignment in ES6

A way to extract values from arrays or objects into variables easily.

## Template literals in ES6
